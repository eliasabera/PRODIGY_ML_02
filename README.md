# PRODIGY_ML_02
# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on their **annual income** and **spending score**. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to help businesses make **data-driven marketing strategies**.  

This project was completed as part of an **internship opportunity at Prodigy Infotech**.

## 🚀 Features
- Implements **K-Means Clustering** for customer segmentation  
- Uses **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters  
- **Data visualization** using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Identifies **high-value customers, budget buyers, and potential spenders**  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains **customer annual income and spending scores**. It helps classify customers into meaningful groups based on their purchasing behavior.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 🎨
- Scikit-Learn 🤖
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 🔧 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eliasabera/PRODIGY_ML_02.git
   cd PRODIGY_ML_02
2. Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
  jupyter notebook
4. Open kmeans.ipynb and execute the cells to visualize the customer clusters


## 📊 Results & Analysis
After applying **K-Means clustering**, the customers were grouped into different segments based on their annual income and spending score. The identified clusters are:

- **High-income, high-spending customers** → VIP group 💎  
  - These customers earn a lot and spend a lot.
  - Business strategy: Offer premium memberships, exclusive discounts, and loyalty programs.

- **Low-income, high-spending customers** → Bargain hunters 💰  
  - These customers don’t earn much but spend a lot.
  - Business strategy: Focus on installment payments, discounts, and promotions to retain them.

- **High-income, low-spending customers** → Potential buyers 🎯  
  - These customers earn well but don’t spend much.
  - Business strategy: Encourage spending through personalized recommendations, high-end products, and incentives.

- **Low-income, low-spending customers** → Budget-conscious buyers 🛒  
  - These customers earn little and spend little.
  - Business strategy: Target them with affordable products and budget-friendly deals.

The cluster visualization shows distinct groups, helping businesses tailor their marketing strategies to each segment.
